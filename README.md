# Insider Threat Detection üîç

## Overview

This project aims to identify potential insider threats within an organization by analyzing employee activity data, including file access, email behavior, login patterns, and role assignments. Through detailed investigation and data analysis, I uncovered usr-zvn as a likely insider threat based on suspicious patterns. Additionally, the repository includes Python code to analyze login and logoff patterns for Finance staff in January, visualized with bar charts.

The journey began with a broad goal: detect anomalous behavior among employees. After diving into the data, the evidence pointed to usr-zvn as the primary suspect.

## Project Structure

* **Insider_Threat_Detection.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the code for data analysis and visualization.
* **Data Files**:
    * email_data.csv: Email activity logs.
    * file_data.csv: File access logs.
    * web_data.csv: Web activity logs.
    * login_data.csv: Login and logoff logs.
    * usb_data.csv: USB activity logs.
    * employee_data.csv: Employee role assignments.
* **README.md**: This file, outlining the project and findings.

## The Investigation üéØ
Initially, the task was to sift through employee data to spot potential insider threats. I analyzed various datasets‚Äîfile access, emails, logins, and roles‚Äîlooking for anomalies. Here‚Äôs how I pinpointed usr-zvn as the insider:

#### Key Discoveries
* **Excessive File Access**: usr-zvn accessed /docs/clients 3,716 times in a year‚Äîway more than any other employee. This raised a red flag about possible misuse.
* **Dual Roles**: Unlike others, usr-zvn was registered in both Finance and Security roles, granting unusual privileges that could be exploited.
* **Suspicious Emails**: They sent 116 emails to themselves, an odd pattern hinting at data exfiltration.
* **Login Anomalies**: While most staff logged in between 7-9 AM and off between 5-6 PM, usr-zvn‚Äôs patterns seemed off (further login analysis could confirm this).

## Data Analysis üìä

The notebook includes:

1. **Data Loading**: Imports CSV files into pandas DataFrames with datetime parsing.
2. **Finance Staff Login Analysis**:
    * Filters login data for Finance staff in January.
    * Visualizes login/logoff distributions by hour.
    * Identifies peak login and logoff times.
    * Node Graph to see the connections of users.
3. **Insider Threat Detection:** Custom analysis that led to identifying usr-zvn.

## Conclusion
After piecing together these clues, the evidence strongly suggests usr-zvn is an insider threat. The combination of excessive access, dual roles, and self-emailing paints a picture of deliberate misuse‚Äîconfirmed through my analysis.
